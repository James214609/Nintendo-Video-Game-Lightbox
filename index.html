            <h2 class="lb-heading">Super Mario</h2>
            <p class="lb-text">Nintendo's flagship series, originally created by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka and first released in 1985 on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Super Mario Brothers revolves around Mario (left) and his taller younger brother Luigi (right), with additional help from the Toads and Yoshis, traversing the Mushroom Kingdom (and some other places) after Bowser and his Koopa Troop, who create many evil plans, most of them involving kidnapping Princess Peach. Mario and crew have also starred in many spin-off games as well such as racing games (Mario Kart), party games (Mario Party), and sports games as well. Mario is also the best-selling video game series of all time and THE king of video games.</p>

            <h2 class="lb-heading">The Legend of Zelda</h2>
            <p class="lb-text">Another flagship series for Nintendo, The Legend of Zelda is an action-adventure game where you play as Link (pictured left) and traverse Hyrule defeating enemies and slaying Ganon, an evil pig monster who is bent on obtaining the Triforce, a special element that can grant whoever claims all free pieces of it anything they wish and reshape Hyrule into a dark and scary world. The three major characters each possess a different piece of the Triforce. Ganon possesses the Triforce of Power, Zelda, the Princess of Hyrule, possesses the Triforce of Wisdom, and Link, the hero, possesses the Triforce of Courage, and this drives the main conflict in every Zelda game. The Legend of Zelda has been a staple of Nintendo consoles since the first game was released back in 1986.</p>

            <h2 class="lb-heading">Animal Crossing</h2>
            <p class="lb-text">Created by Katsuya Eguchi and Hisashi Nogami, Animal Crossing is Nintendo's series of life simulation games where you live in a village with many different anthromorphic animals. Some of these animals also run various services, such as Blathers the owl who runs the museum where you can donate bugs, fish, fossils and artworks (assuming the artworks are not forgeries), Tom Nook and his nephews who run the town store, The Able Sisters who are tailors, and Isabelle (pictured left) who works at Resident Services. Animal Crossing has been a staple of Nintendo systems since the first worldwide release back in 2002 on Nintendo GameCube.</p>

            <h2 class="lb-heading">Splatoon</h2>
            <p class="lb-text">From the same Nintendo development team that made Animal Crossing comes Splatoon, Ninendo's take on third-person shooters with emphasis on fashion and music. As a humanoid squid (Inkling) or octopus (Octoling) you can fire paint across the arena and swim and hide into it to refill in intense three-minute paintball matches, or five-minute objective-based matches alongside and against other players online and worldwide. You can also take part in ocassional Splatfests where you play on a team you can select and battle it out for the most points. Additional game modes include single-player campaigns (some of theme released as DLC) and the co-operative Salmon Run player-vs-environment mode. Three Splatoon games have been released so far, the first came out on Wii U back in 2015.</p>

            <h2 class="lb-heading">Pikmin</h2>
            <p class="lb-text">Pikmin resolves around the player leading a tiny plant-animal hybrid known as Pikmin to complete tasks, retrieve objects and thrive in alien worlds across a distant planet in outer space in this series of real-time straegy games. Each of the different coloured Pikmin has their own unique abilities (reds are fire resistant, yellow are shock-proof and blues can swim through water) giving the game a puzzle-solving aspect, and in the fourth game, you can ride a dog, named Oatchi (picutred farthest right). Over 5 games (four mainline, and a spin-off) have been released since the series began on the Nintendo GameCube during the system's launch back in 2001.</p>

            <h2 class="lb-heading">Kirby</h2>
            <p class="lb-text">Kirby is a cute little pink ball that is quite a powerhouse! Created my Masahiro Sakurai at HAL Laboratory and first released on the Game Boy in 1992, Kirby can inhale his enemies or other objects and spit them back out. He can also swallow enemies and copy their abilities to use himself. Kirby's adventures take place in Dream Land on Planet Popstar, but 2022's Kirby and the Forgotten Land teleported Kirby into an alernate dimension where he could also hold a car and some other items in his mouth to give him more crazy abilities. Kirby also once dabbled in a racing game in 2003, and is HAL Laboratory's flagship series. Kirby is also very well known for it's soundtracks in the video games, especially with the theme songs, which have become a highlight among fans.</p>
